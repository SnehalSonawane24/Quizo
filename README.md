# Quiz App 
# Quiz App - README

## Overview

A full-stack quiz application built with **Django (Python)** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database. The app supports both **Admins** and **Users** with role-based functionalities, REST APIs, WebSocket for real-time communication, and JWT-based authentication.

## Features

### Admin

* Create, edit, delete quizzes
* Add/manage questions (MCQ, True/False, etc.)
* Store and manage answer keys
* Launch/publish quizzes with scheduling
* Manage users and assign roles
* View detailed student reports (scores, time taken, answers)
* Analyze overall quiz performance (average, pass/fail rates, common mistakes)
* Export reports (CSV/PDF)
* Set reattempt policies (number of attempts, allow/disallow)
* Send notifications/announcements
* Manage quiz categories/tags

### User (Student)

* Register/Login (JWT authentication)
* Browse available quizzes
* Attempt quizzes with live timer and progress bar
* Submit answers and view results instantly (if allowed)
* Review answers and see correct solutions (if enabled)
* Reattempt quizzes (if permitted)
* Track performance history and progress
* Access leaderboard/rankings
* Receive notifications about quizzes and results
* Edit profile and track personal performance summary

### General

* REST APIs for all major operations
* WebSockets for live quizzes, leaderboards, and notifications
* Role-based access control (Admin vs User)
* Quiz scheduling (start/end time)
* Error handling & validations (quiz expiry, duplicate attempts, etc.)
* Mobile-friendly frontend (React)

### Advanced (Future Enhancements)

* Randomized question orders
* Question banks with difficulty levels
* Adaptive quizzes (difficulty adjusts based on performance)
* Gamification (badges, achievements)
* Real-time monitoring (admins see live quiz attempts)
* AI-powered cheating detection
* Support for multimedia questions (images, video, audio)
* Multilingual support

## Tech Stack

### Backend

* **Django** (REST framework for API development)
* **Django Channels** (WebSockets for real-time communication)
* **JWT Authentication** (secure login & role-based access)

### Frontend

* **React** (single-page application)
* **Redux/Context API** (state management)
* **Material-UI / TailwindCSS** (UI components and styling)

### Database

* **PostgreSQL** (relational database for storing quizzes, users, results)

### Other Tools

* **Docker** (for containerization)
* **Celery + Redis** (for async tasks like sending notifications)
* **Swagger / Postman** (API documentation & testing)

## Project Structure (High-Level)

```
quiz-app/
│── backend/        # Django project (APIs, models, auth, WebSockets)
│── frontend/       # React app (UI, components, pages)
│── docs/           # Documentation & API specs
│── docker/         # Docker config files
│── README.md       # Project overview
```

## Next Steps

* Finalize DB schema design
* Define API contracts (CRUD for quizzes, auth, reports)
* Implement authentication & role-based access
* Develop frontend quiz flows
* Integrate WebSockets for live quiz updates
* Add testing & CI/CD pipeline
